# Trivy Security Scan Suppressions
# Portfolio Project - Documented Risk Acceptances

# AVD-AWS-0132: S3 bucket encryption with customer managed keys
# Justification: AES256 (S3-managed) encryption is sufficient for:
# - Log data (low-value, non-sensitive)
# - Public static website content
# - Personal portfolio project (not regulated)
# KMS adds $1/month per key with minimal security benefit for this use case

# s3-bucket-logging: S3 bucket logging
# Justification: Logs bucket cannot log to itself (circular dependency)
# CloudFront and S3 access logs are already enabled on main buckets
s3-bucket-logging

# s3-no-public-access: Public access blocks
# Justification: False positive - public access IS blocked via:
# - aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block resources
# - Origin Access Control (OAC) for CloudFront
# - Explicit bucket policies denying public access

# DS026: Dockerfile HEALTHCHECK
# Justification: Development container does not need health checks
# Container runs locally in VS Code dev container, not in production
